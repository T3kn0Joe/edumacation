# Edumacation

Here's my bastardized syllabus largely taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP), a free online 'coding boot camp'. The coursework for TOP has been incorporated into the syllabus and I tried to reinforce their curriculum with helpful and free tutorials from either [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=aria) or Youtube. I tried my best to only include tutorials that do not require the need to use proprietary software, but since I haven't taken them yet, I'm not sure if this was successful (for example, I want to know how to create SVGs without using Adobe Illustrator). 

## Why Edumacation?
The reasoning behind this is that I've never really figured out how one is supposed to 'study' while doing these coding things. When one first begins a code challenge (like 100 Days of Code or whatever), it's really hard to practice the simple stuff you've just learned and the core concepts for how to actually do stuff can be totally lost on noobs like myself (like, it took a long time for me to figure out let vs var since one tutorial merely touched on scope and I completely missed it).

The other reason for taking this approach is because the Odin Project really emphasizes on Ruby, which is great but I'm not 100% certain if Ruby on Rails is the framework I want to completely embrace. I wanna try lots of different stuff, and then go from there. I also want whoever else uses this project to be able to decide for themselves the one they are more interested in (if any). So in addition to Ruby I've got a bunch of other seemingly interesting things to learn as well. However, since this still follows the Odin Project, Ruby is just that thing that will probably be really focused on while we continue our learning journey. 

Finally, I'm doing this as a sort of thoroughly structured 100 Days of Code Challenge for myself. I need a bit more structure than "go code for an hour a day", and to be honest I'm not really sure I can code everyday without getting burned out (I still have a day job). Therefore, Edumaction consists of 100 hours of Project Work to satisfy the 100 Days of Code, and an additional 145 hours of learning online. The 145 hours is _in addition to_ the coursework that The Odin Project uses. This will allow for studying and ensuring that things are drilled into my dense head. With any luck, this will be the way to go.

Thus, the more than 245 total non-coursework hours roughly equates to 10 hours of study a week. This way someone can follow along with this doing slightly more than 100 hours a week if they don't actually want to participate in The Odin Project. If they do, they'll need to put in a bit more time to get through their modules, but a lot of the non-project course work is fairly redumdant. So theoretically many of the non-project courses can be skipped since they're there mostly to go over something that hasn't been explained elsewhere, or to provide another way of explaining a topic.

In the end, I just want us to try to get as far as humanly possible and have a dope portfolio to show for it.
